## Brainstorming for Quarter 2 Project Proposal

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesint topic covered in my domain this quarter is what we will be using to implement dynamic surveying. We will be implementing something similar to Akinator which is an online video game that the Data Smith Lab has taken inspiration from created their own unique game. We will be implementing the idea of trees/pruning that is provided in the database of question and answer to determine how to create a dynamic survey that can be personalized for each user.  

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A potnetial investigation I would like to pursue is the Dynamic Survey that I mentioned above. This could involve testing different algorithms for pruning trees more effectively or analyzing how the game adapts the questions to improve user experience and personalization.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I think a different approach I would take is potentially the structure of the code we have right now. It is very unorganized and uncommented so it takes a long time to understand how it works and even longer to implement soemthing new. So if I could I would like to reorangize everything while working.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
I would be interested in using machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning to better understand the user's preferences and optimize the questions. Additionally, I’d explore using clustering or classification techniques to group users with similar profiles for more efficient pruning of the question tree.
